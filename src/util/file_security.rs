//! Cross-platform secret-file hardening.
//!
//! `runtime.json` and `state.json` carry per-daemon secrets (the bearer
//! token, model paths, last-launch params) and must not be readable by
//! other accounts on the machine. On Unix this is the explicit
//! `chmod 0o600` applied during atomic-write. On Windows there's no
//! mode-bit equivalent; we apply a Protected DACL that grants
//! Generic-All to the file owner and no inheritance from the parent.
//!
//! Unix mode-bit application lives in [`crate::util::atomic_write`].
//! This module only contains the Windows surface; on Unix the
//! `set_owner_only_dacl` function is a no-op compile-time stub.
//!
//! The SDDL string `D:P(A;;GA;;;OW)` expands as:
//! - `D:` — DACL section
//! - `P` — Protected (no inheritance from the parent)
//! - `(A;;GA;;;OW)` — Allow ACE granting Generic All to the OWner
//!
//! Best-effort by design: a failure to apply the DACL is logged and
//! swallowed. The state directory is already under `%LOCALAPPDATA%`,
//! which inherits a per-user ACL, so the file is non-readable to
//! other users even without explicit hardening. The DACL apply here
//! is belt-and-suspenders against misconfigured parent ACLs.
//!
//! On Unix the module also hosts the shared directory swap-surface
//! check ([`dir_swap_surface`]) used by the init binary-adoption,
//! config-write, and doctor preflights. A directory is a "swap
//! surface" when a user other than its owner could rename/replace a
//! file inside it, which would let an attacker substitute the adopted
//! `llama-server` or a `0600` config.
