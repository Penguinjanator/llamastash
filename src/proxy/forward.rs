//! Byte-pipe forwarding of `/v1/...` requests to a Ready upstream
//! `llama-server`.
//!
//! Once [`super::route::decide`] produces a [`RouteDecision::ReadyAt`],
//! the router hands the buffered body + the target port off to
//! [`forward_to_upstream`]. The contract is intentionally minimal:
//!
//! - Mirror inbound method, path, query, and headers (stripping
//!   hop-by-hop entries per RFC 7230).
//! - Forward the **buffered body bytes** with at most two surgical edits:
//!   `body.model` when the launch pins a request-model name, and whatever the
//!   serving backend needs for its engine
//!   ([`crate::backend::Backend::rewrite_request_body`]). Both copy every
//!   untouched entry as the client's own bytes — the body is never re-encoded.
//!   The plan's Risks row "rewrites body.model" makes the case for this; the
//!   `received_body` echo assertions in `tests/proxy_routing.rs` keep it
//!   honest.
//! - Stream the upstream response body through `http_body_util::StreamBody`
//!   so SSE chunks land at the client as they arrive. No buffering,
//!   no per-chunk parse.
//! - Stamp `x-llamastash-served-by` + `x-llamastash-fallback-reason`
//!   only when [`RouteDecision::fallback == true`] — set by the
//!   family-MRU fallback path.
